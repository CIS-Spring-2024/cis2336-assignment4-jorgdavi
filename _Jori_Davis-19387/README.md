This is a webpage created for CIS2336
The webpages were created for a new diner at the Sugar Land campus.

The folder contains static and dynamic webpages for users.

I did not want to change the file structure because I wanted everything
to be able to work upon submission. I had difficulty with the server.js 
file initially. I had to change this file so it knew where to find the
diner order form. I ran into an issue when trying to display the confirmation page.
I couldn't figure out how to send the server output to the new confirmation page.
I could either serve the total amount on a blank page or just the confirmation page
without the total.

Bug fix: I was able to fix the transition slides on the menu webpage. The file name
was incorrect on the javascript file.
